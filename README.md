# Room-Computer
Room-Computer is a simple room controller and is basically a controller for your gadgets. *This is a work-in-progress* so keep in mind that more features will be added in the future. Check the [feature list](#features) to view all of the current supported things and stuff.

### Installation
	git clone https://github.com/E-Almqvist/roomcomputer.git
This is written in python, so you will literally only have to clone this repository.

### Configuration
Create a copy of the file "default-config.py" and name it "config.py" then configure its contents to your needs.

#### Hue Light Controller
You can create presets in the "presets.py" file. Follow this syntax *(and Python syntax of course)*:
```python
PRESETS = {
	"mypreset": {
		"color": (178, 199, 255), # RGB, from 0-255
		"brightness": 100 # from 0-255
	},
}
```
